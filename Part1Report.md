# Part I: Student database using lists
### Motivation:
This report goes over my solution for creating a student database using two types of lists, array-based and linked, and benchmarking both solutions. The goals being finding out with of my implimentations require the least amount of time for a certain workload, discussing why one preform better or worse for a certain workload, why I implemented the lists the way I did it and what changes can be made for difference gains.
